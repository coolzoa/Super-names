# Super-names
Node JS app that uses npm packages superheroes and supervillains to display a random superhero or supervillain name. The app also uses Express for the backend and routing, EJS for creating templates and layouts, and Bootstrap for some of the frontend.

## Getting Started
Once cloned the git repository, run the command:
npm install

You can then run the application with node index.js and the server will be setup.

Finally, access the app with localhost:3000/ on your web browser.

### Prerequisites

Have node installed in your machine
